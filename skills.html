  <p>Media Relations:</p>
  <p>This school project was about learning the fundamentals of media relations. We had to find a real news story to pitch to the local media in December. My story was about the not-for-profit thrift store chain Goodwill. I interviewed a staff member on how Goodwill has helped her gain confidence and have a positive outlook on life. </p>
